Fixed wireless Internet service availability of a particular location is dependent on several factors including, location, geographical data such as elevation, the surrounding and the area specific characteristics such as type of trees as well as RF noise in the location. Technicians have to do an onsite survey to determine the service availability of a particular location. In this work, a machine learning based prediction model is developed to determine the likelihood of service availability without doing an onsite survey. Several characteristics including available customers in the proximity, geographical data, and tower locations are used as input features to build a prediction model.

The application is developed using Python, Django, MySQL, Scikit-Learn, GoogleMaps API and JavaScript. The prediction process is fully streamlined and technicians are able to get a comprehensive report including propability of service availability, neighbourhood data, RF parameters of the location, once a potential customer submit a service availability request through the company web site.

Prediction model performs automaticÂ  re-training in regular intervals to provide most accurate estimations.
